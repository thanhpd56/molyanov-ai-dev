name: online-pipeline
description: |
  Runs the full feature lifecycle (request → interview → approve → implement → PR → finalize)
  through GitHub Actions and GitHub issues/PRs/comments only, with no local terminal or `claude`
  CLI session required for any step.

  Use when: "bật online-pipeline", "setup online pipeline", "cài online-pipeline cho repo",
  "chạy user-spec qua GitHub Actions", "online pipeline github actions", "enable online pipeline"

  This skill has two audiences: (1) a human asking to enable it on a repo — see Setup below; (2)
  `claude -p` running non-interactively inside a GitHub Actions job — see Stages below. The
  workflow YAML always names which stage to run.

# Online Pipeline

Reuses `user-spec-planning`, `code-writing`, and `documentation-writing` unchanged except for the
two controlled exceptions listed in [Modified Skills](#modified-skills-and-why) below. This skill
is the GitHub-Actions-specific orchestration layer on top of them: it decides, per stage, what
non-interactive `claude -p` should do, and leaves PR/label/merge mechanics to deterministic bash in
the workflow files (not to the agent), so GitHub state never depends on the agent phrasing a `gh`
command correctly.

## Naming Contract

Every workflow and every stage agree on these derived names — recompute them, never invent a new
scheme:

- `slug` = kebab-case(issue title, truncated to 40 chars) + `-` + issue number (e.g.
  `add-dark-mode-42`). Deterministic from `issue.title` + `issue.number` alone, so any job can
  recompute it without a lookup table. The trailing segment after the last `-` is always the
  issue number.
- Feature folder: `work/{slug}/` (identical to local `user-spec-planning`/`code-writing` usage).
- Spec branch: `userspec/{slug}`, spec PR label: `userspec-spec`.
- Code branch: `feature/{slug}`, code PR label: `userspec-implement`.
- Status marker (written by the agent as its last action, read by the workflow, never read by
  another skill): `work/{slug}/logs/working/online-pipeline-status.yml`, a single line
  `status: {value}`. Values: `in_progress` (default — overwritten to this before every run, so a
  crash leaves no stale success signal), `awaiting_decision` (stopped for a user decision),
  `ready_for_review` (userspec stage only — validation clean, spec PR should be opened/updated),
  `ready_for_pr` (implement stage only — implementation complete, code PR should be opened).
- Automation signal: the literal string `ONLINE_PIPELINE_AUTOMATED`, included in every
  `userspec-turn` and `finalize` prompt (the two stages that call a modified skill). Not needed for
  `implement`/`implement-resume` — `code-writing` does not check for it.

The agent communicates with the user exclusively through `gh issue comment {issue_number} --body
"..."` — chat/stdout output is not read by anyone in a CI job. Every stage prompt supplies the
issue number explicitly; use it for every comment.

## Setup (human-facing)

To enable online-pipeline on an existing repository, resolve this skill's directory and run
`scripts/setup-online-pipeline.sh` from the target repo root. It copies the three workflow files
from `assets/workflows/` into `.github/workflows/`, offers to set the needed secrets via `gh secret
set`, and prints the manual steps the user must still do in a browser (see the script's own output
for the authoritative, current list).

A project scaffolded by `project-initialization` already has these workflow files in
`.github/workflows/` (see that skill's `assets/new-project/`) — do not run the setup script there;
only the secrets and the manual browser steps remain.

## Stages

### Stage: userspec-turn

Covers interview, completeness check, draft, and validate — i.e. `user-spec-planning` Steps 1–5.
Triggered once per issue comment (or once on issue open) by `online-pipeline-userspec.yml`.

1. The workflow has already reset the status marker to `in_progress` before invoking you; always
   write a final status before exiting, even on a plain interview turn that is neither a stop nor a
   completion (leave it `in_progress` in that case).
2. If `work/{slug}/user-spec.md` does not exist yet: this is the first run for this issue. Call
   `user-spec-planning`'s Start path directly with the given `slug` (do not let it choose its own
   slug) and the issue body as the initial task description.
3. Otherwise: call `user-spec-planning`'s Resume path. Treat the latest issue comment supplied in
   the prompt as the newest user answer — append it through the normal interview loop exactly as a
   live chat reply would be.
4. Whenever `user-spec-planning` would "ask the user" (interview questions, a completeness-checker
   gap, a `user_decision_required` validation finding), post the question with `gh issue comment`
   instead of chat output. Write `status: awaiting_decision` to the status marker *before* this
   commit, not after: commit+push `logs/userspec/interview.yml` and the status marker (and any
   other changed state) to `userspec/{slug}` immediately, then exit 0. Writing status after the
   push would leave it uncommitted and invisible to any later run — each GitHub Actions run is a
   fresh checkout with no memory of this one, including no local disk continuity. This is a normal
   stop, not a failure.
5. Append `ONLINE_PIPELINE_AUTOMATED` to the context you hand `user-spec-planning` for Step 5
   (validate) so its automated-resume branch activates; it is a no-op for the other steps.
6. Run Steps 1–5 exactly as `user-spec-planning/SKILL.md` defines them, with one exception: **do
   not run Step 6 ("Obtain Approval")**. That step is replaced entirely by the PR + `/approve`
   comment flow below — do not ask for approval in a comment or chat.
7. When Step 5 validation ends clean (all three reviewers `clean`): write `status: ready_for_review`
   to the status marker, then commit and push it with `userspec/{slug}` as usual, and exit 0. The
   workflow opens or updates the spec PR after you exit — do not call `gh pr create` yourself.
8. If an existing spec PR already exists for this branch (e.g. the user commented again after
   review asking for a change, which `user-spec-planning` Step 6's own rule routes back to
   validation), just keep pushing to the same branch; the open PR updates automatically.

### Stage: implement

Triggered once, when the spec PR (branch `userspec/{slug}`, label `userspec-spec`) merges. The
workflow has already created `feature/{slug}` from `main` and checked it out.

1. Read the approved `work/{slug}/user-spec.md` and `decisions.md`. Implement it using the
   `code-writing` skill's normal process (including its review waves) against the current
   repository — nothing online-pipeline-specific changes how `code-writing` itself works.
2. If a reviewer in `code-writing`'s review waves returns a finding with `user_decision_required:
   true` that is not a technical/tooling error: write `status: awaiting_decision` to the status
   marker, then commit it together with the work completed so far to `feature/{slug}` and push,
   then post the question with `gh issue comment {issue_number}`, then exit 0. **Write the status
   marker and commit it before pushing, never after** — the next run that resumes this stop is a
   fresh checkout on a different runner with no disk continuity from this one; it can only see
   `awaiting_decision` if that commit actually reached `origin/feature/{slug}`. A status write that
   happens after the push, or that is never committed, is invisible to that later run and silently
   breaks the resume path. This stop is not a technical failure — the workflow does not count it
   against the 2-retry cap.
3. On successful completion: write `status: ready_for_pr` to the status marker, commit it with all
   remaining work to `feature/{slug}`, push, and exit 0. The workflow opens the code PR (label
   `userspec-implement`) after you exit — do not call `gh pr create` yourself.
4. Any other exit (crash, uncaught tool error, non-zero exit code without a committed status write)
   is a technical failure. The workflow resets `feature/{slug}` to the last pushed commit and
   retries you from there — commit the status marker together with everything else defensively
   before anything risky, so a mid-run crash loses as little as possible.

### Stage: implement-resume

Same as `implement`, except `feature/{slug}` already has a checkpoint commit from a prior
`awaiting_decision` stop, and the prompt supplies the latest issue comment as the answer to the
question you asked last time. Continue from the existing branch state — do not restart the
implementation from `main`. The same three exit outcomes (steps 2–4 above) apply.

### Stage: finalize

Triggered once, when the code PR (branch `feature/{slug}`, label `userspec-implement`) merges. Runs
on `main` directly — there is no branch for this stage.

1. Append `ONLINE_PIPELINE_AUTOMATED` to the context you hand `documentation-writing`'s Feature
   Finalization Mode. Its automated branch skips "ask whether to continue finalization" and always
   continues — the merge itself is the user's confirmation.
2. Run `documentation-writing`'s Feature Finalization Mode exactly as written otherwise: update
   Project Knowledge, move `work/{slug}/` to `work/completed/{slug}/`, commit.
3. Commit straight to `main` (there is no finalize branch) and push. If anything fails before this
   final commit/push, `main` is untouched — the workflow simply reruns this stage from a fresh
   checkout, no reset needed. If it fails after push (e.g. the connection drops right after), the
   next run's `work/completed/{slug}/` existence check (done by the workflow, not by you) already
   detects completion and skips re-running you; you do not need your own idempotency check.

## Modified Skills and Why

Both changes are gated on the literal string `ONLINE_PIPELINE_AUTOMATED` appearing in the prompt
context; neither changes interactive (local) behavior.

- `user-spec-planning/SKILL.md` Step 5 and `assets/interview.yml.template`: when automated and a
  reviewer returns `user_decision_required`, the round number and the pending finding are saved to
  `interview.yml` before commenting and stopping, so the next automated run resumes the same round
  (not round 1). Step 3 is untouched — it runs once, with no round concept, so nothing is lost
  when a session ends there.
- `documentation-writing/SKILL.md` Feature Finalization Mode: when automated, the "feature looks
  incomplete, continue?" question is skipped and finalization always continues.

## Setup Script Maintenance

If `assets/workflows/*.yml` changes (new secret, new label, new branch-naming scheme), update this
file's Naming Contract and `scripts/setup-online-pipeline.sh`'s printed instructions together —
they describe the same contract from two angles and will drift silently otherwise. Also copy the
updated files over
`skills/project-initialization/assets/new-project/.github/workflows/` (plain duplicates, not a
build step or symlink — matches how that scaffold already vendors
`.claude/skills/project-knowledge/`) and update the matching steps in that scaffold's `README.md`.
