## Categories of Bad Tests

### Category 1: Empty/Meaningless Tests

Tests that verify nothing:

```typescript
// BAD - Tests nothing
test('should exist', () => {
  expect(true).toBe(true);
});

// BAD - No assertions
test('renders component', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
});

// BAD - Only checks function exists
test('function defined', () => {
  expect(typeof myFunction).toBe('function');
});
```

### Category 2: Tests That Only Replay Mock Setup

Apply the main skill's observable-contract rule. The diagnostic signal is that the assertion only
restates configured mock behavior and would pass without the meaningful result or required
outgoing interaction:

```typescript
// BAD - The configured call proves no result or required interaction contract
test('calls API', async () => {
  await fetchUserData(1);
  expect(api.get).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/users/1');
  // No assertion on the actual result!
});

// Tests mock wiring, not code behavior
const mockUser = { id: 1, name: 'Alice' };
mockUserService.create.mockResolvedValue(mockUser);
const result = await handler(req, res);
expect(result).toEqual(mockUser);
// Litmus test: delete handler implementation → test still passes
```

### Category 3: Missing Scenario Coverage

An explicit requirement or distinct changed risk has no test at a reliable boundary:

- requested or changed observable behavior is unprotected;
- a meaningful changed branch or failure path can violate that behavior without detection;
- a specified edge case is not exercised;
- cross-component behavior is covered only by tests that cannot reproduce its integration risk.

The absence of a per-function, per-file, or per-branch test is not a finding when another reliable
boundary already protects the distinct risk or the path has no established behavioral contract.

### Category 4: Boundary Mismatch

A test uses the wrong boundary when it cannot reproduce the risk it claims to protect, exercises
substantially more system than that risk requires with a concrete reliability or maintenance
cost, or duplicates the same risk at another boundary without adding distinct protection.

The number of unit, integration, and E2E tests is not evidence by itself. Judge the selected
boundary against the actual behavior and failure mode.

### Category 5: Mocks Replace the Meaningful Behavior

Inspect whether the chosen boundary still exercises a decision, transformation, error, or
required interaction. Mock count starts that investigation but does not prove a defect:

```typescript
// INVESTIGATE - Are decisions still exercised, or has every meaningful collaborator been replaced?
test('user service', () => {
  const mockDb = jest.mock('database');
  const mockCache = jest.mock('cache');
  const mockEmail = jest.mock('email');
  const mockLogger = jest.mock('logger');
  // At this point, what are we even testing?
});
```

A finding exists only when tracing the test shows that mocks replace the behavior it claims to
protect. Several mocks can still be appropriate for a unit with a clear responsibility.

### Category 6: Test Anti-patterns

- **Implementation testing** - Tests break when refactoring without behavior change
- **Snapshot abuse** - Large snapshots nobody reviews
- **Flaky tests** - Random failures due to timing/order
- **Shared state** - Tests depend on each other
- **Magic values** - Unexplained test data

### Category 7: Static Content Tests

Apply the main skill's `Not a Test Subject` rule. These tests may pass the litmus test because
deleting the text makes them fail; the diagnostic question is whether the assertion protects an
explicit invariant or merely freezes editable content and presentation.

## Consequence and Severity

Classify a demonstrated problem by the regression that can pass undetected under its realistic
conditions, not by the test smell's category. The same missing branch can be severe in a payment
flow and limited in an optional presentation detail. A naming preference, possible assertion
improvement, or pyramid preference without concrete impact is not a finding.

- `critical` — an undetected regression can cause a security breach, data loss, destructive
  behavior, or failure of a core project contract;
- `high` — it can break a material user or system behavior;
- `medium` — it can break a real secondary behavior or make a meaningful regression invisible;
- `low` — it has a concrete but narrowly limited consequence.

## Review Process

1. **Identify Requirements and Tests**: Read the changed behavior, its contracts, and supplied tests
2. **Map Protection**: Match each distinct required scenario and realistic risk to existing tests
3. **Analyze Each Test**:
   - Does it have meaningful assertions?
   - Does it test real behavior or just mocks?
   - Does it cover the right scenarios?
4. **Check Boundaries**: Confirm each scenario uses the smallest boundary that reliably reproduces
   its risk and does not duplicate existing protection
5. **Find Gaps**: Identify required scenarios or distinct changed risks with no reliable protection

## Litmus Test Methodology

For every test touching business logic, ask:

> "If I remove the core logic line being tested, does this test still pass?"

**How to apply:**
1. Identify the core logic line (computation, validation, or side effect)
2. Mentally remove it
3. Trace test execution without that line
4. If test still passes → flag as litmus test failure
