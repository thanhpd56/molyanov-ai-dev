# Smoke Testing Guide

Smoke tests verify the smallest real boundary that answers "is the system alive?" Keep only the
startup, initialization, deployment, or infrastructure paths whose failure would make deeper
checks unhelpful.

## What to Test

- Key modules/packages can be imported
- App can start (renders, server starts, CLI runs)
- Required configuration is accepted

Do not turn smoke coverage into a second feature suite. A module import may be sufficient for a
library; a deployed service may require its health endpoint and minimum required integration.
Use real connections only when the system cannot be meaningfully alive without them and the
environment provides a safe controlled target.

## Example

**File:** `tests/smoke.test.ts`

```typescript
describe('Project Setup - Smoke Test', () => {
  it('should have NODE_ENV configured', () => {
    expect(process.env.NODE_ENV).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should be able to import main module', () => {
    expect(() => require('../src/index')).not.toThrow();
  });
});
```

Python equivalent: `tests/test_smoke.py` with an `import src.main` check and an env-var check.

## When CI Orchestration Is in Scope

Do not restructure an existing pipeline merely because a smoke test was added. When the user or
project contract requires a separate smoke stage, it may run first and gate slower suites because
deeper checks have little value when the system cannot start:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  smoke-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test -- tests/smoke.test.ts

  unit-tests:
    needs: smoke-test  # Only run if smoke passes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test -- tests/unit/
```
