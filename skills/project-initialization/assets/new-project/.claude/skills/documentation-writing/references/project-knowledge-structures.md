# Project Knowledge Structures

Choose structure by context boundaries, not document size. A separate file is useful when agents
can work on that area without loading unrelated domains. Existing filled Project Knowledge keeps
its current structure unless the user asks to reorganize it; missing, template, and partially
filled initial documentation may adopt one of the structures below.

## Compact

Use one `project-knowledge/SKILL.md` for a small project whose durable context is best read together.
Keep concise sections for:

- Project
- Architecture
- Patterns
- Deployment
- UX/design and domain facts when applicable

A section may simply state that it is not applicable, such as a local skills project with no
deployment. The frontmatter description must route the project's real tasks to this skill.

## Standard

Use a router plus four core references for a coding or operational project:

```text
project-knowledge/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── project.md
    ├── architecture.md
    ├── patterns.md
    └── deployment.md
```

The core owners are:

- `project.md`: purpose, audience, problem, key capabilities, priorities, and scope boundaries.
- `architecture.md`: stack and rationale, project structure, components, dependencies,
  integrations, data flow, data model, and sensitive-data boundaries.
- `patterns.md`: project-specific code and naming patterns, Git workflow, testing and verification,
  security gates, and business rules.
- `deployment.md`: platform and environments, the routine delivery path, direct-operation
  boundary, agent or operations host, variable names, CI/CD triggers, production authorization,
  rollback, monitoring placement and notification routing, and emergency recovery. State clearly
  when the project is local-only or has no deployment rather than deleting this owner.

Add `ux-guidelines.md` when the project has significant custom UI. It owns interface language,
tone and copy patterns, domain glossary, design system, and accessibility.

## Domain-Extended

Start with the standard core, add `ux-guidelines.md` when applicable, then add domain references
such as `bot.md`, `vault.md`, or `api.md` for independently useful areas. A domain file owns its
component-specific behavior and gotchas; cross-cutting project, architecture, pattern, deployment,
and UX facts remain in their core owners.

Do not extract a domain merely because a file is long. Extract it when selective loading makes a
real task cheaper or clearer without forcing the reader to reconstruct missing shared context.

## Router Contract

`project-knowledge/SKILL.md` is the entrypoint for every structure. After adding, deleting, or
renaming documentation files, update its overview, links, and conditional task routing. Remove
links to files that no longer exist and avoid duplicating the reference content in the router.

For a new structure or an explicitly requested reorganization, present the exact files and the
owner of each in one concise proposal. Ask the user to approve it or choose another option, and
write only after the response. Once approved, preserve that topology during ordinary documentation
updates.
