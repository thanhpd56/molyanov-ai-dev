# A project scaffolded by project-initialization already has all of this vendored in; run this

Remaining manual steps (cannot be scripted — each requires browser authentication):

  1. Install the Claude GitHub App on this repository.
     Easiest path: run `claude` locally once and use `/install-github-app`, or visit
     https://github.com/apps/claude and select this repository.

  2. Create the Claude auth credential if you have not already:
     - OAuth (subscription): run `claude setup-token` and copy the printed token.
     - API key: create one at https://console.anthropic.com and copy it.
     Store whichever one you chose as a repo secret (see above).

  3. Create a Personal Access Token (classic or fine-grained, 'repo' scope) at
     https://github.com/settings/tokens and store it as the GH_PAT secret (see above).
     This is required only so that approving a spec PR can trigger the implement job.

Once all three secrets are set and the GitHub App is installed, open a new issue on this repo to
start the pipeline.
